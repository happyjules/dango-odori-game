To play the game:
	Use 'wasd' to move around the room.
	Use spacebar to pick up a dango.
	Use 'r' to reset position in room.
	Use 'i' to toggle viewing the instructions.
	Use 'm' to toggle playing the music.
	Press restart to set score back to 0.
	(If you press restart please click outside the screen so the 
	spacebar does not get stuck on the restart button.)

Advanced Topic : Collision Detection
	We implemented collision in our function called detectCollision. We found the 
	location of the tip of the chopstick by using the position of the camera and the 
	dimensions of the camera. Since the chopsticks are sticking out of the camera at an 
	angles of 2 degrees, length of 2, and offcentered by .5, we used trig to find the location.
	We compared the tip of the chopstick to the center positions of each dango. Since the dangos
	have a radius of .5 but squish, we checked to see if the distance between the chopsticks and the
	dango were less than .6 to assume they collided. 

The scene.js generates 3D cube objects which are the room and chopsticks.
The dango_body.js generates the 3D tetrahedral/sphere objects were are the dango and eyes.
